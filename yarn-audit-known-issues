This removes the ability to craft JWEs that would consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\nIf users are unable to upgrade their required library version they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms.\n\n- they can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether\n- they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an discussion in the project's [repository](https://github.com/panva/jose/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=GHSA-jv3g-j58f-9mq9%20advisory%20question)\n* Email me at [panva.ip@gmail.com](mailto:panva.ip@gmail.com)\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jv3g-j58f-9mq9"},"1093150":{"findings":[{"version":"0.2.5","paths":["multer>busboy>dicer"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=0.3.1","module_name":"dicer","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-wm7h-9275-46v2","cves":["CVE-2022-24434"],"access":"public","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2023-08-28T14:22:55.000Z","recommendation":"None","cwe":["CWE-248"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1093150,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24434\n- https://github.com/mscdex/busboy/issues/250\n- https://github.com/mscdex/dicer/pull/22\n- https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DICER-2311764\n- https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-2838865\n- https://github.com/mscdex/dicer/commit/b7fca2e93e8e9d4439d8acc5c02f5e54a0112dac\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wm7h-9275-46v2","created":"2022-05-21T00:00:25.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Crash in HeaderParser in dicer","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"This affects all versions of the package `dicer`.

This is because it both (1) defaults to [SHA1][SHA1 wiki], a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure [since at least 2005][Cryptanalysis of SHA-1] and (2) defaults to [one single iteration][one iteration src], a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to [preimage][preimage attack] and [collision][collision attack] attacks.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\n1. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high.\n2. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high.\n\nProbability / risk analysis / attack enumeration:\n\n1. [For at most $45,000][SHA1 is a Shambles], an attacker, given control of only the beginning of a crypto-js PBKDF2 input, can create a value which has _identical cryptographic signature_ to any chosen known value.\n4. Due to the [length extension attack] on SHA1, we can create a value that has identical signature to any _unknown_ value, provided it is prefixed by a known value. It does not matter if PBKDF2 applies '[salt][cryptographic salt]' or '[pepper][cryptographic pepper]' or any other secret unknown to the attacker. It will still create an identical signature.\n\nUpdate: PBKDF2 requires a pseudo-random function that takes two inputs, so HMAC-SHA1 is used rather than plain SHA1. HMAC is not affected by [length extension attacks][Length Extension attack]. However, by defaulting to a single PBKDF2 iteration, the hashes do not benefit from the extra computational complexity that PBKDF2 is supposed to provide. The resulting hashes therefore have little protection against an offline brute-force attack.\n \n[cryptographic salt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) \"Salt (cryptography), Wikipedia\"\n[cryptographic pepper]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography) \"Pepper (cryptography), Wikipedia\"\n[SHA1 wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 \"SHA-1, Wikipedia\"\n[Cryptanalysis of SHA-1]: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html \"Cryptanalysis of SHA-1\"\n[one iteration src]: https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/1da3dabf93f0a0435c47627d6f171ad25f452012/src/pbkdf2.js#L22-L26 \"crypto-js/src/pbkdf2.js lines 22-26\"\n[collision attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision \"Collision Attack, Wikipedia\"\n[preimage attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack \"Preimage Attack, Wikipedia\"\n[SHA1 is a Shambles]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf \"SHA-1 is a Shambles: First Chosen-Prefix Collision on SHA-1\nand Application to the PGP Web of Trust, Gaëtan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin\"\n[Length Extension attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack \"Length extension attack, Wikipedia\"\n\ncrypto-js has 10,642 public users [as displayed on NPM][crypto-js, NPM], today October 11th 2023.

This code has been the same since crypto-js was first created.\n\n#### Further Cryptanalysis\n\nThe issue here is especially egregious because the length extension attack makes useless any secret that might be appended to the plaintext before calculating its signature.\n\nConsider a scheme in which a secret is created for a user's username, and that secret is used to protect e.g. their passwords. Let's say that password is 'fake-password', and their username is 'example-username'.\n\nTo encrypt the user password via symmetric encryption we might do `encrypt(plaintext: 'fake-password', encryption_key: cryptojs.pbkdf2(value: 'example username' + salt_or_pepper))`. By this means, we would, in theory, create an `encryption_key` that can be determined from the public username, but which requires the secret `salt_or_pepper` to generate. This is a common scheme for protecting passwords, as exemplified in bcrypt & scrypt. Because the encryption key is symmetric, we can use this derived key to also decrypt the ciphertext.\n\nBecause of the length extension issue, if the attacker obtains (via attack 1), a collision with 'example username', the attacker _does not need to know_ `salt_or_pepper` to decrypt their account data, only their public username.\n\n### Description\n\nPBKDF2 is a key-derivation is a key-derivation function that is used for two main purposes: (1) to stretch or squash a variable length password's entropy into a fixed size for consumption by another cryptographic operation and (2) to reduce the chance of downstream operations recovering the password input (for example, for password storage).\n\nUnlike the modern [webcrypto](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#pbkdf2-operations) standard, crypto-js does not throw an error when a number of iterations is not specified, and defaults to one single iteration. In the year 2000, when PBKDF2 was originally specified, the minimum number of iterations suggested was set at 1,000. Today, [OWASP recommends 1,300,000][OWASP PBKDF2 Cheatsheet]:\n\nhttps://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/4dcaa7afd08f48cd285463b8f9499cdb242605fa/src/pbkdf2.js#L22-L26\n\n### Patches\nNo available patch. The package is not maintained.\n\n### Workarounds\nConsult the [OWASP PBKDF2 Cheatsheet]. Configure to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.\n\n### Coordinated disclosure\nThis issue was simultaneously submitted to [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) and [crypto-es](https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es) on the 23rd of October 2023.\n\n### Caveats\n\nThis issue was found in a security review that was _not_ scoped to crypto-js. This report is not an indication that crypto-js has undergone a formal security assessment by the author.\n\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf"},"1096470":{"findings":[{"version":"6.5.2","paths":["express>qs","@hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck>superagent>qs","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>express>body-parser>qs","protractor-screenshot-utils>protractor>webdriver-manager>request>qs"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=6.5.0 <6.5.3","module_name":"qs","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","cves":["CVE-2022-24999"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=6.5.3","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2024-02-13T20:35:50.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 6.5.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096470,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428\n- https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/4310742efbd8c03f6495f07906b45213da0a32ec\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/727ef5d34605108acb3513f72d5435972ed15b68\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/73205259936317b40f447c5cdb71c5b341848e1b\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/8b4cc14cda94a5c89341b77e5fe435ec6c41be2d\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/ba24e74dd17931f825adb52f5633e48293b584e1\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/e799ba57e573a30c14b67c1889c7c04d508b9105\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/ed0f5dcbef4b168a8ae299d78b1e4a2e9b1baf1f\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/f945393cfe442fe8c6e62b4156fd35452c0686ee\n- https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/fc3682776670524a42e19709ec4a8138d0d7afda\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp","created":"2022-11-27T00:30:50.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"qs vulnerable to Prototype Pollution","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"qs before 6.10.3 allows attackers to cause a Node process hang because an `__ proto__` key can be used.

This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`.

This allows an adversary to exploit specific scenarios where the compression ratio becomes exceptionally high. As a result, the length of the JWE token, which is determined by the compressed content's size, can land below application-defined limits. In such cases, other existing application level mechanisms for preventing resource exhaustion may be rendered ineffective.\n\nNote that as per [RFC 8725](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#name-avoid-compression-of-encryp) compression of data SHOULD NOT be done before encryption, because such compressed data often reveals information about the plaintext. For this reason the v5.x major version of `jose` removed support for compressed payloads entirely and is therefore NOT affected by this advisory.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time or memory during JWE Decryption operations.\n\n### Affected users\n\nThe impact is limited only to Node.js users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs to decrypt JWEs from untrusted sources.\n\nYou are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you\n\n- Your code uses jose version v5.x where JWE Compression is not supported anymore\n- Your code runs in an environment other than Node.js (e.g. Deno, CF Workers), which is the only runtime where JWE Compression is implemented out of the box\n- Your code does not use the JWE decryption APIs\n- Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources\n\n### Patches\n\n`v2.0.7` and `v4.15.5` releases limit the decompression routine to only allow decompressing up to 250 kB of plaintext. In v4.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the `inflateRaw` decryption option implementation. In v2.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the `inflateRawSyncLimit` decryption option.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade and do not want to support compressed JWEs you may detect and reject these tokens early by checking the token's protected header\n\n```js\nconst { zip } = jose.decodeProtectedHeader(token)\nif (zip !== undefined) {\n  throw new Error('JWE Compression is not supported')\n}\n```\n\nIf you wish to continue supporting JWEs with compressed payloads in these legacy release lines you must upgrade (v1.x and v2.x to version v2.0.7, v3.x and v4.x to version v4.15.5) and review the limits put forth by the patched releases.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open a discussion in the project's [repository](https://github.com/panva/jose/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=GHSA-hhhv-q57g-882q%20advisory%20question)","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhhv-q57g-882q"},"1096856":{"findings":[{"version":"1.15.3","paths":["axios>follow-redirects","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>axios>follow-redirects"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=1.15.5","module_name":"follow-redirects","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","cves":["CVE-2024-28849"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.15.6","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"updated":"2024-04-02T17:54:22.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.15.6 or later","cwe":["CWE-200"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096856,"references":"- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/security/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp\n- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b\n- https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#authentication-entries\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28849\n- https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/1885\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/2390009\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOIF4EPQUCKDBEVTGRQDZ3CGTYQHPO7Z\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","created":"2024-03-14T17:19:42.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"follow-redirects' Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"When using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), its dependency follow-redirects only clears authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but allows the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce & PoC\n\nTest code:\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\naxios.get('http://127.0.0.1:10081/', {\n headers: {\n 'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',\n 'ProXy-AuthoriZation': 'Rear Test',\n 'coOkie': 't=1'\n }\n})\n .then((response) => {\n console.log(response);\n })\n```\n\nWhen I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header is kept.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability may lead to credentials leak.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nRemove proxy-authentication header during cross-domain redirect\n\n### Recommended Patch\n\n[follow-redirects/index.js:464](https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b)\n\n```diff\n- removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n+ removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|proxy-authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp"},"1097210":{"findings":[{"version":"3.1.9","paths":["ejs"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<3.1.10","module_name":"ejs","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-ghr5-ch3p-vcr6","cves":["CVE-2024-33883"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=3.1.10","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"updated":"2024-05-01T08:25:04.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 3.1.10 or later","cwe":["CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097210,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33883\n- https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/e469741dca7df2eb400199e1cdb74621e3f89aa5\n- https://github.com/mde/ejs/compare/v3.1.9...v3.1.10\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghr5-ch3p-vcr6","created":"2024-04-28T18:30:31.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"ejs lacks certain pollution protection","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The ejs (aka Embedded JavaScript templates) package before 3.1.10 for Node.js lacks certain pollution protection.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghr5-ch3p-vcr6"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":34,"high":14,"critical":2},"dependencies":663,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":664}}
