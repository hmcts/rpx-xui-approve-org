If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.

All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.","cwe":"CWE-22","patched_versions":">=4.4.16 <5.0.0 || >=5.0.8 <6.0.0 || >=6.1.7","title":"Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning using symbolic links","recommendation":"Upgrade to versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, 6.1.7 or later","access":"public","url":"https://npmjs.com/advisories/1779"}}}
